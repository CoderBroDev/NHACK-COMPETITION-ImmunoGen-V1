# NHACK-COMPETITION-ImmunoGen-V1
We are Team Semicolon Specialists, consisting of Gokul, Gaurang, and Veera. We are focused on revolutionizing the methods of preventing the deadly and notorious disease, HIV, using a microbot called ImmunoGen-V1. 
## What is ImmunoGen-V1 
We aim to introduce the CCR5 Gene Variant in the body,
our team decided to introduce a new technology capable of insinuating the gene into the body through a Nanobot.
<br>
ImmunoGen-V1 is a nanobot capable of introducing the gene through bluetooth technology and through radar sensing in the safest way possible

### How does it work?
ImmunoGen-V1 was designed with the idea of trying to introduce the CCR5 gene into the body in safest way possible.
<br>
With the help radar sensing the nanobot will be able to pinpoint the location of the release of the CCR5 gene variant in the body and this is done with the help of an AI which is made using Teachable Machine. The ultrasonic sensors along with the cameras will be able to know exactly what is in their path by making use of distance reading.
<br>
Regarding the bluetooth technology used an app will be utilised to consolidate the data from the plethora of sensors, which will be then used to understand whether the gene has been deployed or not and will also check whether the person has HIV or not. It will also be used to control the motors
