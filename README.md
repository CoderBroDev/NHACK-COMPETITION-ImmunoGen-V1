# NHACK-COMPETITION-ImmunoGen-V1
We are Team Semicolon Specialists, consisting of Gokul, Gaurang, and Veera. We are focused on revolutionizing the methods of preventing the deadly and notorious disease, HIV, using a microbot called ImmunoGen-V1. 
## What is ImmunoGen-V1 
We aim to introduce the CCR5 Gene Variant in the body,
our team decided to introduce a new technology capable of insinuating the gene into the body through a Nanobot.
<br>
ImmunoGen-V1 is a nanobot capable of introducing the gene through bluetooth technology and through radar sensing in the safest way possible

### How does it work?
ImmunoGen-V1 was designed with the idea of trying to introduce the CCR5 gene into the body in safest way possible.
<br>
With the help radar sensing the nanobot will be able to pinpoint the location of the release of the CCR5 gene variant in the body and this is done with the help of an AI which is made using Teachable Machine. The ultrasonic sensors along with the cameras will be able to know exactly what is in their path by making use of distance reading.
<br>
Regarding the bluetooth technology used an app will be utilised to consolidate the data from the plethora of sensors, which will be then used to understand whether the gene has been deployed or not and will also check whether the person has HIV or not. It will also be used to control the motors
## What's Next?

<br>
We want to educate the people on the measures that can be taken to successfully prevent HIV from ruining the lives of you and your loved ones. to do so, we have designed an ingenious app that gamifies the entire experience of learning about HIV making it suitable for all age groups.
<br>
What have we done for this?!?!?! 
## Introducing IHIV-Shield
This app aims to explain the concepts of HIV, its symptoms, the preventive measures the general population can take to successfully rebuke this deadly infection and also to provide up to date data on the grasp this infection has on the worlds population 
<br>
To make this app more appealing to the younger generation, a puzzle-like game will also be integrated into this app
## Conclusion
Well this is our proposal to the deadliest diseases on earth-HIV. In conclusion, our journey today has taken us through the world of CCR5 gene variants and their potential impact on HIV resistance. This exhibition serves as a testament to the ongoing efforts to combat one of the most significant global health challenges. We hope that the research and innovations showcased here will inspire you to learn more and support the continued fight against HIV. Thank you for joining us on this enlightening expedition, and we look forward to further progress in the field of HIV prevention and treatment.
